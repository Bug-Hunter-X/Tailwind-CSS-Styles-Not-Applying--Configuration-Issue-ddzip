The issue is that Tailwind CSS isn't applying styles as expected due to a missing or incorrect configuration step. This could manifest as styles not being applied at all, or the wrong styles being applied.  This often happens when there's a problem with the `tailwind.config.js` file, the `postcss.config.js` file, or improper inclusion in your HTML.
