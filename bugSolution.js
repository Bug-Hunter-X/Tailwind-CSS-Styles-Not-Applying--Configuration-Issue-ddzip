The solution involves checking and updating the following files:

**1. `tailwind.config.js`:
Ensure that your `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured. It should include:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Replace `'./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'` with the actual paths to your HTML and component files. This `content` array tells Tailwind where to look for the classes you're using. 

**2. `postcss.config.js` (if needed):
Verify your PostCSS configuration. This file is usually needed if you use a CSS preprocessor like PostCSS.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

**3. HTML inclusion:
Make sure your HTML file correctly includes the Tailwind CSS styles. You'll typically do this via a build step, but in a basic example you would do something like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white">Hello, world!</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

After making these changes, rebuild your project.  Ensure that the correct output file (e.g., `output.css`) is linked in your HTML.
